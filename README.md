# LBP and HOG
### by Vito Kurnik
Implementation of LBP and HOG in Python using PyCharm.
### LBP
Local binary patterns (LBP) is a type of visual descriptor used for classification in computer vision. LBP is the particular case of the Texture Spectrum model proposed in 1990. LBP was first described in 1994. It has since been found to be a powerful feature for texture classification; it has further been determined that when LBP is combined with the Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) descriptor, it improves the detection performance considerably on some datasets.
### HOG
Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is an image feature descripts to describe the image based on the gradients directions and magnitudes. In this implementation, the following is calculated:
 - Horizontal and vertical gradients.
 - Gradient magnituge.
 - Gradient direction.
 - Histogram for a given cell.
